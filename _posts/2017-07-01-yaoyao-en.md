### Why choose Jump Rope?
Choosing workout is personal; I choose a suitable but the best work out for me.
Running is a good choice, but if there is no plastic track, or a pair of good running shoes, it may cause knee injuries. Plus, running is limited by the weather condition. 

### Jump Rope is a No-Excuse work out.

Jump rope is a very simple and economical aerobic workout. You can excise anytime, anywhere. It is also timesaving: Jump 20 minutes takes about the same energy as 30 minutesâ€™ running.

### YaoYao is designed for Apple Watch  
Currently you can choose to run or ride, swim or other types of workout on Apple Watch, but not Jump rope. The most important thing of Jump rope is about counting. There is no Jump application available on Apple Watch, only some apps which you must hold while Jump. YaoYao is an Apple Watch app. It utilizes the Apple Watch motion sensor to calculate your Jump. YaoYao costs you no more than an ordinary Jump rope.
